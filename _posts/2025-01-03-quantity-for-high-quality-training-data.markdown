The quantity of images needed for high-quality training data depends on several factors:

Complexity of the Task â€“ Simple tasks (e.g., digit recognition) need fewer images, while complex tasks (e.g., object detection in autonomous driving) require more.
Variability in the Data â€“ More variation (e.g., lighting, angles, backgrounds) requires a larger dataset.
Model Type â€“ Deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, Transformers) require significantly more data than traditional ML models.
ðŸ”¹ General Guidelines Based on Task
Task	Minimum Images per Class	High-Quality Dataset
Classification (Simple)	1,000 - 5,000	10,000+
Classification (Complex)	10,000 - 50,000	100,000+
Object Detection	5,000 - 20,000 per class	50,000+
Segmentation	10,000 - 50,000 per class	100,000+
Anomaly Detection	1,000 - 10,000 normal + few hundred anomalies	50,000+ normal & 5,000+ anomalies
ðŸ”¹ Image Collection Best Practices
Diverse Conditions â€“ Capture images in various lighting, angles, occlusions, and backgrounds.
Balanced Classes â€“ Ensure each category has enough images to avoid bias.
Augmentation â€“ If collecting data is hard, use techniques like flipping, rotation, and color jittering.
Annotated Data â€“ Use high-quality labels; consider multiple annotators for accuracy.
Domain-Specific Needs â€“ Some domains (e.g., medical imaging) may need fewer but highly precise samples.
