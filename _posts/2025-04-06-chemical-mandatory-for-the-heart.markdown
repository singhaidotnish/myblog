Several essential chemicals and nutrients support heart health, including:

Macronutrients & Electrolytes
Omega-3 Fatty Acids – Found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts; reduce inflammation and improve cholesterol levels.
Potassium – Regulates blood pressure and heart rhythm (found in bananas, spinach, and sweet potatoes).
Magnesium – Helps maintain normal heart rhythm and relax blood vessels (found in nuts, seeds, and whole grains).
Calcium – Supports muscle contractions, including the heart (found in dairy, leafy greens, and fortified foods).
Sodium – Necessary in small amounts but excess can increase blood pressure.
Vitamins & Antioxidants
Vitamin D – Plays a role in blood pressure regulation and heart function (from sunlight, fortified foods, and fish).
Vitamin K – Helps with blood clotting and prevents arterial calcification (found in leafy greens and fermented foods).
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) – Supports energy production in heart cells and acts as an antioxidant (found in meat, fish, and nuts).
B Vitamins (B6, B12, Folate) – Reduce homocysteine levels, which can lower heart disease risk (found in eggs, leafy greens, and legumes).
Vitamin C & E – Help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in arteries (found in fruits, vegetables, and nuts).
Other Key Compounds
Nitric Oxide Precursors (L-Arginine & L-Citrulline) – Help relax blood vessels and improve circulation (found in watermelon, nuts, and meat).
Polyphenols & Flavonoids – Found in dark chocolate, berries, and tea; improve blood vessel function.
Fiber (Soluble Fiber) – Lowers cholesterol and stabilizes blood sugar (found in oats, beans, and apples).
