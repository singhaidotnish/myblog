The primary similarity between Ruby on Rails and Jekyll is that they are both built using the Ruby programming language, 
allowing developers to leverage similar syntax and libraries, and both are commonly used to create websites, with the key 
difference being that Rails is a full-fledged web application framework for building dynamic sites, while Jekyll is a static 
site generator, ideal for simpler, content-focused websites like blogs
