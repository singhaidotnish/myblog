about-author: Hey there! I’m Nishith Singhai, a creative and energetic individual with a passion for animals, adventure, 
  and hands-on crafting. Living with ADHD has shaped the way I approach life—always curious, always exploring, 
  and never afraid to try something new. I’ve had the thrill of riding cross-country, embracing the excitement 
  of the open trail, and I love working with my hands, crafting unique objects from PVC and leather as a fun side hobby. 
  Whether I’m out in nature or working on my next creative project, I find joy in pushing limits and bringing ideas to life. 
  Let’s connect—whether it’s about systems, creativity, animals, or just sharing a love for new experiences!
